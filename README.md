# Royal Navy Capital: Online Banking Landing and Sign-In Page

This project was created using React, SCSS, and Stylized Components. 
Deployed Using Netlify: royal-navy-capital.netlify.app

The general theme for this project was to get re-acquinted with Web Development, specifically Front End Development.
React was used for its ease of modularity through the use of conternization via components using the Flux Paradigm to ensure maximum code maintainability and unidirectional data flow.
React Stylized Components was used for out-of-the-box intergration with React, further improving on Reacts' modularity by including styling that can be containerized to specific components and further reinforcing the Flux Paradigm.
SCSS was used for its pre-processing styling power, enabling the use of global variables and import to be used within a master-style sheet, creating reinforced style containerization for general Web Components when necesscary. 
React Router was also used to minimize server calls within the page itself by manipulating the DOM of single page applications, useful for controling progressive resolution
views between pages. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
